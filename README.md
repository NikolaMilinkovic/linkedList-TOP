# Linked List
A linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains a value and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and can easily grow or shrink. They are efficient for inserting and deleting elements in the middle of the list but less efficient for accessing elements randomly.
