# linkedList-TOP
This is a part of The Odin Project curriculum on data structures.

This lesson was a good introduction to the data structures and required of me to create an implementation of my own linked list with its methods.

# Linked List methods:
 - insertListHead(data)
 - getListData()
 - appendNewNode(data)
 - getListSize()
 - getListHead()
 - getListTail()
 - atIndex()
 - pop()
 - contains(value)
 - find(value)
 - toString()
